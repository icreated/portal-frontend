## Installing / Getting started

Run `npm install`.

This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory (if one doesnâ€™t exist yet) and will download packages to that directory.


By default, Idempiere Portal API REST endpoints are installed here:

[http://localhost:8080/portal/api/](http://localhost:8080/portal/api/)

Change constant `ApiUrl` in `environments/environments.ts` if different



### Deploying / Publishing / Testing

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You are redirected to login page. To get started fill in the form with: gardenusr/GardenUser
